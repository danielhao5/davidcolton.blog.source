Title: Changing the Theme of my Blog 
Slug: new_theme_for_blog

# Adding a personal touch

In my last post [Building My Blog]({filename}/articles/20200304_building_my_blog.md) I described how I followed a great tutorial to get my Blog site up and running with [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican). However,before I start blogging in anger, I wanted to change the look of the site a bit to suit my own personal tastes. I quickly narrowed my choices for the new theme down to three options:

1. [Alchemy](https://github.com/nairobilug/pelican-alchemy)
1. [Voce](https://github.com/limbenjamin/voce)
1. [Elegant](https://github.com/Pelican-Elegant/elegant)

I really liked all three and the choice was difficult but in the end I settled for **Alchemy**. It is worth noting though that I decide to change theme again Voce and Elegant will immediately be in contention.

# Setting up Alchemy

The instruction on how to install and configure Alchemy are very will described on the Alchemy site so I won't regurgitate here, but these are the highlights.

## Installation

I installed Alchemy as a Github sub-module so in your Pelican site:

    :::text
    mkdir themes
    git submodule add https://github.com/nairobilug/pelican-alchemy themes/pelican-alchemy

And then in Pelican config:

    :::python
    THEME = 'themes/pelican-alchemy/alchemy'

## Plugins

[Bootstrapify](https://github.com/ingwinlu/pelican-bootstrapify) is used for rendered HTML. This was also installed as a Github sub-module.

    :::text
    mkdir plugins
    git submodule add https://github.com/ingwinlu/pelican-bootstrapify plugins/pelican-bootstrapify

And in Pelican config:

    :::python
    # http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/plugins.html#how-to-use-plugins
    PLUGIN_PATHS = ['plugins']
    PLUGINS = ['pelican-bootstrapify']

    BOOTSTRAPIFY = {
        'table': ['table', 'table-striped', 'table-hover'],
        'img': ['img-fluid'],
        'blockquote': ['blockquote'],
    }

I already had both a `plugins` folder and plugins in use so no need for me to create the folder. I just added `pelican-bootstrapify` to my existing `PLUGINS` variable.

The main reason I like this theme is this approach to tables. Hopefully I won't regret it in the future.

## Favicons
I created a site image and then used [Favicon Generator](http://realfavicongenerator.net/) to generate a favicon package and download it. I'll come back to the site image in a moment.

Then, to install:

    :::text
    mkdir content/extras
    unzip <PATH_TO_PACKAGE>.zip -d content/extras

There was an extra step required here. I had to rename the supplied `site.webmanifest` file to `manifest.json`

And then in Pelican config and the `extras` folder to the `STATIC_PATHS` variable as well as the `EXTRA_PATH_METADATA`:

    :::python
    # https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/wiki/Tips-n-Tricks#second-solution-using-static_paths
    STATIC_PATHS = ['extras', 'images']
    EXTRA_PATH_METADATA = {
        "extras/android-chrome-192x192.png": {"path": "android-chrome-192x192.png"},
        "extras/android-chrome-512x512.png": {"path": "android-chrome-512x512.png"},
        "extras/apple-touch-icon.png": {"path": "apple-touch-icon.png"},
        "extras/browserconfig.xml": {"path": "browserconfig.xml"},
        "extras/favicon-16x16.png": {"path": "favicon-16x16.png"},
        "extras/favicon-32x32.png": {"path": "favicon-32x32.png"},
        "extras/favicon.ico": {"path": "favicon.ico"},
        "extras/manifest.json": {"path": "manifest.json"},
        "extras/mstile-150x150.png": {"path": "mstile-150x150.png"},
        "extras/safari-pinned-tab.svg": {"path": "safari-pinned-tab.svg"},
    }
    
    RFG_FAVICONS = True

## Other small details

In addition to the main changes above I also made a few smaller changes to complement the theme.

1. I added a `SITESUBTITLE`
1. I added a `SITEIMAGE`
1. I added `ICONS`

The site subtitle is just a variable in your Pelican config file. Enough said. The site image wasn't too much bother either. I added the site image to the `images` folder that I'd previously created and then just added the variable to Pelican config:

    :::python
    SITESUBTITLE = "The ramblings of a frustated Python Data Scientist ..."
    SITEIMAGE = "/images/python_programming.png width=150 height=150"

Icons took me a little while to understand and get working. The Alchemy theme does not have a side bar so the Social links need a new home. This is where Icons come in. I thought that I understood all this but for the life of me the Icons of my Social Links wouldn't appear, even though I could see them in the static HTML. This took too long to figure out and in the end I was kicking myself. I was doing everything perfect except that I didn't realise that the [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons were case sensitive. Here is the working Icons entries in my Pelican config:

    :::python
    ICONS = (
        ("twitter", "https://twitter.com/David__Colton"),
        ("github", "https://github.com/davidcolton/"),
        ("linkedin", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidcolton/"),
    )

# Adding Maths

Part of what I've planned for this blog will mean I need the ability to add Mathematical formulas. [render_math](https://pypi.org/project/pelican-render-math/) to the rescuer. When installing this plugin the instructions suggestion adding the entire `pelican-plugins` as a sub-module of my source tree. Not something I wanted to do. Instead I did clone the plugins repository but in it's own right and I then just copied the `render-math` plugin into the `plugins` folder. My Pelican config was then updated:

    :::python
    PLUGIN_PATHS = ["plugins/"]
    PLUGINS = ["pelican-bootstrapify", "i18n_subsites", "render_math"]

And to check that everything is working as expected, some sample math formulas:

$$e=mc^2$$

Look good. Basic maths working.

# Oh, before I forget

Before I forget you'll need to install Typogrify and BeautifulSoup4.

    :::text
    pip install typogrift
    pip install beautifulsoup4 

This is not the last post on my setup and environment. I want to look closer at the options provided by `make` and also describe my development environment setup.

More anon.
